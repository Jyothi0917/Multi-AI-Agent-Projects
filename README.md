# Multi-AI-Agent-Project

This repository showcases a Multi-Agent Skincare Routine Generator built using CrewAI and Hugging Face LLMs. The project includes the following agents:

- **Skin Profile Expert**: Analyzes user's skin type, concerns, and environment.
- **Routine Generator Specialist**: Creates a personalized 3-4 step skincare routine based on the skin profile.
- **Product Advisor**: Recommends products for each skincare step, focusing on suitability for sensitive skin.

## Features:

- **Skin Analysis**: Identifies the user's skin type, concerns (like acne, dullness), and environmental factors (like humidity or pollution).
- **Routine Creation**: Generates a tailored skincare routine with morning and night steps.
- **Product Recommendations**: Suggests products based on the generated routine.

## Technologies Used:

- **CrewAI**: A platform for building AI agents.
- **Hugging Face LLM**: Leveraging large language models for natural language processing tasks.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies (e.g., crewai, huggingface_hub, etc.).
3. Run the agent system using your own Hugging Face API key.
4. Input your skin details, and the agents will provide a skincare routine and product suggestions.
