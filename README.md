# Multi-AI-Agent-Project
This repository showcases a Multi-Agent Skincare Routine Generator built using CrewAI and Hugging Face LLMs. The project includes the following agents:

1. Skin Profile Expert: Analyzes user's skin type, concerns, and environment.

2. Routine Generator Specialist: Creates a personalized 3-4 step skincare routine based on the skin profile.

3. Product Advisor: Recommends products for each skincare step, focusing on suitability for sensitive skin.

Features:
  1. Skin Analysis: Identifies the user's skin type, concerns (like acne, dullness), and environmental factors (like humidity or pollution).

  2. Routine Creation: Generates a tailored skincare routine with morning and night steps.

  3. Product Recommendations: Suggests products based on the generated routine.

Technologies Used:
  1. CrewAI: A platform for building AI agents.

  2. Hugging Face LLM: Leveraging large language models for natural language processing tasks.

Getting Started:
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

  2. Install dependencies (e.g., crewai, huggingface_hub, etc.).

  3. Run the agent system using your own Hugging Face API key.

Input your skin details, and the agents will provide a skincare routine and product suggestions.






Note: The output shown is from a test run, and due to the unexpected API behavior, the final output might have some repetitions.
